Application for bike sharing users:
<ul>
<li>Bike(s)/slot(s) nearby.</li>
<li>Favorite stations</li>
<li>Save money with the timer.</li>
</ul>
I have neither the time to support this program anymore (I now have a child :-) )
nor the motivation (Google gives a lot of Nexus one to everybody except me because of a market limitation)

So I give it it the open-source community. I hope someone will make it better.
